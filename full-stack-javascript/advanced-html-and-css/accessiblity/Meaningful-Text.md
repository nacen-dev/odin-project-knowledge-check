# Meaningful Text

## Knowledge Check

### What are three rules you should follow in order to provide meaningful links?

1. Make sure that the text content of the `<a>` element somehow indicates where the link redirects to and that it’s brief (around 100 characters). So avoid using phrases like “click here” or “this page”.

2. If a link would open or download a file, include text that tells the user what kind of file it is as well as the file size.

3. If a link would automatically open in a new tab or window with the target="\_blank" attribute, you should indicate this to the user in some way.

### What information should you inform users of in order to provide meaningful error messages in forms?

Inform what caused the error and what they can do to fix it.

### When should you use the empty string/null value for the alt attribute?

If the image is purely decorative or the image is not really important for the user to be aware of.
