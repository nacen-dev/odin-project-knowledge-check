# Media Queries

## Knowledge Check

### How do you define a media query to create a mobile layout for your site?

An example would be

```
@media (max-width: 600px) {

}
```

### What is the difference between max-width and min-width in a media query definition?

The difference between them is how the media query will be applied, so on a max-width it will apply this media query until this condition like max-width: 800px it will apply the styles inside the media query if the viewport is less than or equal to 800px, while a min-width will apply the styles while the screen size is greater than or equal to the viewport size
