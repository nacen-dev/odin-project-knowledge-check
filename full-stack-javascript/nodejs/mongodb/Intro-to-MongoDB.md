### What is the difference between a relational database and a non-relational database?

A relational database has relations which refers to a unique collection of tuples. A tuple is an ordered collection of values. A relation is represented as a table, each tuple is represented as a row called as a record. This definition of table and rows is called schema. A non relational database on the other hand does not need to enforce a schema.
