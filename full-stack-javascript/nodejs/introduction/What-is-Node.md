### What is Node?

Node is a asynchronous event driven javascript runtime, this means that you can now use javascript not only for web development but with Node you can now use JavaScript to accomplish what other side server languages can do like PHP, Ruby, C#, and Python.

Asynchronous event driven means that in Node things are not in sequential but rather event driven similar how on the browser we have events that if something happens do this, we do not have to wait for a task to finish before we can do something else at the meantime, it's similar to brushing your teeth while checking your phone.
