# Problem Solving

## Knowledge Check

### What are the three stages in the problem solving process?

1. Understanding the problem
2. Plan
3. Divide and Conquer

### Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?

It's important as not understanding the problem clearly leads to misunderstanding which could lead to outputs that does not solve the problem.

### What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?

Planning helps you to get a clearer understanding of the problem, writing psuedocode or trying to explain what the problem is can help you how to solve the problem.

### What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?

- Check if the program needs a UI (User Interface), if yes then you might need to sketch this in a piece of paper
- Identify the input
- Identify the desired output
- Writing a Psuedocode
- Identify the steps needed to produce the desired output
- Try explaining the problem to another person, or use the rubber duck debugging method

### What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of instruction on how to solve a particular problem.

### What is pseudocode?

Pseudocode refers to writing the process for the program in plain english/your own language to better illustrate a problem as it abstracts the syntax needed by the programming language, letting you focus on the problem itself.

### What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?

- It helps you not to get overwhelmed
- It helps you to deal with complexity
- It helps you know that you are progressing by solving each smaller problem
